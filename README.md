# Playlist Maker

## Create, edit, and explore a playlist

This application will allow a user to create a playlist of arbitrary length. A user will be able to add songs to the 
playlist, with information stored about each song. Various features listed below.

This application will be used by music enthusiasts, or anybody who wants to create a playlist to keep together songs 
they enjoy listening to. This project is of interest to me because I enjoy listening to music, creating playlist, and 
keeping track of information related to songs, artists, and albums.
