# Playlist Maker

## Create, edit, and explore a playlist

This application will allow a user to create a playlist of arbitrary length. A user will be able to add songs to the 
playlist, with information stored about each song.

This application will be used by music enthusiasts, or anybody who wants to create a playlist to keep together songs 
they enjoy listening to. This project is of interest to me because I enjoy listening to music, creating playlists, and 
keeping track of information related to songs and artists.
